Entities & accounts
--------------------

The system is built upon the concept of  *accounts* and 
*transactions*. 

An *account* is wehere the money goes to (or comes from) and 
can be a person, company or a generic destination like for example 'expenses.'

Subaccounts are used for grouping
and better organisation.

The dot `.` sign is used to denote an entity and its (sub)accounts

Example of an entity with a subaccount:
    
`Equity.bank.savings`



Transactions
--------------

Transaction define money flow. In its basic form it is a transfer from A to B.
A tranaction may be taxed (with a VAT for example)
