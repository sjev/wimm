# Introduction 

## What is WIMM

*WIMM* is a text-based acconting tool. It joins the ranks of [plain text accounting](https://plaintextaccounting.org/) software, such as *ledger* and co.

**WIMM features**:

* yaml file format
* support for invoice management
* import of bank statements 
* tax (VAT or BTW in Dutch)


## Why WIMM 

There is a lot of accounting sofware out there, so why *wimm*? 
Well, there are many great advantages of of *plain text accounting*, to name a few of them:

* data is human readable/editable
* plays nicely with version control systems
* new tools/scripts are easy to build

However, I could not find a piece of software that would sufficiently automate my workflow, especially around invoce and tax management. So WIMM was born.
